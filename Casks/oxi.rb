    caveats <<~EOS
      oxi is ad-hoc signed but not Apple-notarized, so macOS quarantines it on install.
      Clear the quarantine attribute once, then launch it:

        xattr -cr /Applications/oxi.app
        open /Applications/oxi.app

      Only do this for software you trust, and do not disable Gatekeeper globally.

      Run `oxi` from a project directory to open it as the first workspace.
